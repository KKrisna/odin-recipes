    <h2>How to Make Chicken Katsu</h2>
    <p class="description">This recipe will show you how to make Chicken Katsu made
        with an authentic recipe of ingredients. This Japanese style fried chicken is crunchy 
        and juicy in each and every bite. This recipe always brings me back to when I visited Tokyo for the
        first time and tried an authentic chicken katsu dish from a small mom and pop shop.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>For the chicken:</h4>
    <ul class="katsu ingredients">
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten with 3 tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>3 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu sauce, for serving</li>
        <li>Steamed sushi rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol class="katsu steps">
        <li>Lightly pound the chicken thighs 1/2 inch-thick and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Put the flour, eggs, and panko in three separate pie plates and season each one lightly with salt.</li>
        <li>Dredge 1 piece of chicken in the flour, tapping off the excess..</li>
